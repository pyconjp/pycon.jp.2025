Would you like to share your knowledge and experience with the Python community? PyCon JP 2025 is currently accepting proposals for talks and poster sessions. We welcome any topic related to Python—including technical content as well as learning, careers, education, and diversity. We value the reason why you want to speak, and encourage submissions from both newcomers and experienced speakers. Proposals can be submitted in either Japanese or English. No prior speaking experience is required—your voice might be the encouragement someone needs to take their first step.

Call for Proposals Period: June 1 (Sun) – June 29 (Sun), 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)
