PyCon JP 2025 has been prepared with the goal of re-examining "how Python is currently learned and used" and creating "the PyCon that is needed now." Chosen as symbols of this endeavor are Ami Otsuka and Sebastián Ramírez. Ami Otsuka's "#100DayChallenge"(#100日チャレンジ) spanned three stages at once—from encountering Python as a mandatory subject in class, to learning it alongside generative AI, to becoming a skilled practitioner who mass-produced 100 applications—updating the possibilities of learning. Her story offers insights not only for young people but also for seniors on how to face new trends. In contrast, Sebastián Ramírez, through FastAPI, which masterfully uses type hints and async, continues to present "ways of writing not yet found in textbooks" to the global community. He provides the next step for those with less experience and gives seasoned developers a stimulus to review their own code. With these two individuals as a starting point, we aim to create a place where each and every participant can find their own "piece of Python," and 100 days later, share their achievements in Hiroshima.
