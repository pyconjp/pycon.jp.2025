In 2025, the Python conference “PyConJP” will be held in Hiroshima under the theme “Gather Python Pieces.” This will be the first time the conference is held outside of Tokyo, with the venue being the International Conference Hall within the Peace Memorial Park. In this place that has continued to pray for and promote peace, the event will be an opportunity to once again feel the ‘diversity’ and “openness” that Python has always valued.

Even those from the Kanto region or farther afield will find special value in taking the time to enjoy technical discussions in the serene atmosphere of Peace Park.  
Why not join us in Hiroshima in September to connect with fellow Python enthusiasts from across the country, discuss code, and even touch on the future of society? Okonomiyaki and oysters await you! See you in Hiroshima in September!
