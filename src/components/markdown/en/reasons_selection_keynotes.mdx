PyCon JP 2025 has been prepared with the goal of rethinking "how Python is being learned and used today" and creating the "PyCon that is needed now." Selected as symbols of this vision are Ami Otsuka and Sebastián Ramírez. Otsuka's "#100 Days Challenge" traversed three stages at once: Python as a mandatory classroom subject, Python learned alongside generative AI, and the expert mass-producing 100 applications. This journey redefined the possibilities of learning. It's a story that offers insights not only for younger generations but also for seniors confronting new trends. In contrast, Ramírez continues to present "code patterns not yet in textbooks" to practitioners worldwide through FastAPI, leveraging type hints and async. He provides next steps for beginners and stimulating challenges for experienced developers to reconsider their code. Starting from these two keynote speakers, we aim to create a space where each participant discovers their own "Python piece," and 100 days later—shares their achievements in Hiroshima.
